# Movies-ETL

## Overview: 

We created a dataset for Amazing Prime and theyve asked us to make sure its updated everyday. For that task, we needed to create an automated pipeline that would take in new data on a daily basis, preform the correct transformations, and send that data into the existing tables. 

## Results

We used data from Kaggle, Wikipedia, and MovieLens to create a Movie database.
